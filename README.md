# DataTables with Server Side
### And Codeigniter


There are many ways to get your data into DataTables, and if you are working with seriously large databases, you might want to consider using the server-side options that DataTables provides. With server-side processing enabled, all paging, searching, ordering actions that DataTables performs are handed off to a server where an SQL engine (or similar) can perform these actions on the large data set. As such, each draw of the table will result in a new Ajax request being made to get the required data.
